# CoinFlipSim
C++ Program that simulates coin flips

This was an early, simple, test project to see how I could simulate coin flips. This program prompts you for the number of times that you want to simulate a coin flip, simulates it, then prints the results (# of times it was heads, tails, % heads, % tails, and total simulations) to the console.
